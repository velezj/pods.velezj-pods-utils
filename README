Name:         velezj-pods-utils
Maintainers:  Javier Velez
Summary:      several useful scripts for PODS
Description:

	The utilities inside this PODS extend the PODS semantics to
	include optional bash-completion setup scripts.

	The main utility is pod-run, which allows for PODS-sensitive
	running of executable(s) and which utilizes the extended 
	PODS bash-completion semantics to allow for bash completion
	of possible binaries in a PODS system as well as completion
	of their PODS specific local arguments.

	We include a CMake file for ease of installing and writing
	such completion scripts if the PODS is built using CMake.
	

Requirements: 
  PODS
  bash (for bash completion, doh!)

    --------------------------------------------------------------
    Extended PODS bash-completion semantics
    
    This system extends the PODS framework to allow for seamless
    bash-completion scripts for binaries.
    
    For a given script <foo>, the bash completion script to source
    (a standard bash script) to setup the bash completion system
    must be installed under BUILD_PREFIX/bash-completion/<foo>.completion.
    
    The BUILD_PREFIX is the same as the PODS BUILD_PREFIX.
    
    The bash script *must* run a bash "complete" command which
    targets the ABSOLUTE PATH of the script (the FULL PATH).
    This is in order to have bash completion correctly work when several
    local PODS build directories are on a development machine with
    similarly named scripts that have different completion options.
    
    The pods-completion.cmake file described bellow allows one to
    write the <foo>.completion template using a @EXECUTABLE_INSTALL_PATH@
    variable which will be correctly expanded upon installation of
    the completion script to the correct location.  This of course 
    requires the use of CMake as the build tool for the PODS.
    
    CMake is *not* required, the extension to the PODS system simply
    dictate the following:
    
    1) bash completion setup script must be installed in 
       BUILD_PREFIX/bash-completion/<script-name>.completion
       
    2) the completion script must setup the completion for the 
       FULL ABSOLUTE PATH to the script.
       hence "complete -f /home/user/projects/build/bin/script_foo"
       rather than "complete -f script_foo"

    --------------------------------------------------------------
    pod-run
    
    Allows you to easily run an executable from a PODS compatible
    system.  The pod-run script will search for the binary PODS
    directory connected with the location called (the current 
    working directory) and will set up PATH and PKG_CONFIG_PATH
    environmental variables to have the PODS binary directory in them.
    The script then calls the command line arguments as a normal
    bash command.

    If the BUILD_PREFIX/bash-completion/pod-run.completion script
    if sourced, the pod-run script will tab-complete to the available
    executable(s) for the current PODS system.
    
    The script and pod-run.completion hook into the pods-completion.cmake
    and the extended PODS bash-completion semantics.  In particular
    the completion will try to locate completion scripts at the
    know PODS location and will call these completion scripts
    during it's own bash completion
    --------------------------------------------------------------


    --------------------------------------------------------------
    cmake/pods-completion.cmake
    
    This is a cmake file which adds the pods_add_bash_completion()
    function to CMake.  This allows you to add and install a 
    completion script in style with the extended PODS bash-completion
    system.  The finale completion scripts are installed under
    BUILD_PREFIX/bash-completion/<target>.completion
